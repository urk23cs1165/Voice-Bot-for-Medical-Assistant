# Voice-Bot-for-Medical-Assistant
This project introduces an AI-powered healthcare voice assistant that uses natural voice interaction to aid with patient triage, symptom assessment, and basic health advice. 
To give safe, real-time responses and help patients make educated healthcare decisions, the system makes use of sophisticated voice recognition, medical information retrieval, and diagnostic decision models.
The voice bot uses Whisper to turn patient speech into text, NLP and diagnostic trees to analyze symptoms, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline based on compressed medical databases to retrieve pertinent medical knowledge. 
Using ScaleDown approaches, medical literature and patient medical history are optimized to improve reaction latency and reduce storage, allowing for quick (<1 second) responses and handling several symptom combinations at once.
Symptom assessment, medication reminders, appointment scheduling, emergency detection, and multilingual communication are some of the system's essential healthcare assistance functions. 
In order to provide authentic, human-like voice responses, it incorporates text-to-speech utilizing ElevenLabs, making it more accessible to patients of various ages and linguistic backgrounds.
Security and privacy are key components of the design. Secure data handling, encrypted communication, role-based access, and patient consent management are just a few of the HIPAA-compliant procedures that the solution adheres to to guarantee the secure use of medical data.
